2. Paste the configurable parameters from [resources/configParams.json](resources/configParams.json) into the "Configuration Parameters" input.

## Notes

Has been tested to work with ArcGIS 10.8.1 but the configurable app template application (the one in portal) needs to be created from Web App Builder Developer edition.
